This project is a group speed game. For this project we used React to create an interactive frontend. We also used Socket.io to create a backend with a mongodb connection for data storage. This project uses Socket.io to create websockets between the user and server, this allows the front end to react dynamically to any actions submitted by their opponent in another browser.
