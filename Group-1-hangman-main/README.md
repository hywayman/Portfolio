This particular project is a group hangman project. For this project I was mostly in charge of the front end. Making sure that the user input was validated properly and the hanged man's picture was changed when needed.

For this project we used a library to generate random words. The user begins by entering their name and the amount of letters in the word that they would like to guess.

As the user guesses letters, we send the users guess to an express backend. The backend responds with a confirmation response that updates the display on the front end.

Finally once the user finishes their game a highscore table is displayed.

The hardest of this project for me was getting the hangman pictures to change correctly through React. I had to experiment quite a lot to get them working.
